  ### Mainly into 2 types
  1.  Copyleft
      > Any derivative, addition or distribution uses same license.

      - Strong copyleft
        >  force use same license, ex GPL

      - Weak copyleft
        > use exact same license as the original one? not sure the diff between weak and Strong

  1.  Permissive
      > Allowing use different license, derivative, addition or distribution do not have to use the same license as the original one.


  ### How to decide?
  > This is main question that you should ask to yourself

  1.  Look any library or framework you use to build your software. What licenses are already in use on those?
  1.  what are Terms of service where your software is hosted?
      >  Github

  1.  Do you want and derivatives, additions and distributions to use same license?


  ### License guidelines
  1.  Only use license that has been approved by [OSI](https://opensource.org/licenses)
