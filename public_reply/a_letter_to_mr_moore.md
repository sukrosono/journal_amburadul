Thank you, Mr. Moore, for this semester and for making me felt that shopping a class on FBS is "pearl beyond price". Taking the final score aside, my promise to you is now I dare to take writing more seriously, especially in English. I also hope that in the future you will allow me to, hmm disturb you.

I already have written some questions but let it be unset for now Mr. Moore. I should remind myself in front of you about this or It will come on next email. :)


I don't know, Mr. More, the clear mistake I did was mentioning "Solidaritas Covid 2019" semi-publicly. It was so dreadfully awful that it was too late for me to read the email "Bantuan Dana Pembelian Pulsa Mahasiswa". Frankly, I should blame someone for this, or at least something. It seems impossible to address that issue inter-personally. Taking a [quick look](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-vyBHZgYNu/?igshid=17hb1pf1jaamr) it will be delivered in ~~May~~.

With the name of both of my parents (due to lack of courage ~~if I have to read this in the future~~), I should ask what is my final score Mr. Moore. Because as long I have become the *Sivitas akademika* of our lovely University, it's 100% I know when and which class I would get **E** score. And now it's just not 100% anymore. (past) The trio clue is a) An Arch-Devil brings unknown disease to this human-body. b) I exceed the 3 Alpha/ Absent threshold. c) My "Tugas Rancang" /Final project broken or I was absent on the presentation, which I should be held accountable for writing some stupid-code or I am consciously or unconsciously contribute a hardware problem on my laptop. And I get Two **E** on my this semester, that fact is a lethal-chaos right on my artery.

Furthermore, I am more than happy if you help me to sort those things out. I am so slow on giving trust to someone new, even she/he professionally credible.

This is how usually FTI student gets their final grade, please let me know:
  1. when you see I have become rude Mr. Moore.
  2. When this violates someone's privacy.


I am so sorry that you read this as public/ open letter. It's forced me not to lie when writing using this format.

I have some ideas for to harness technology, this is just the short version of it. We could utilize [English Stack Exchange](https://english.stackexchange.com/) for Q&A . When you create a collaborative project is should suggest using [Github](https://github.com/) then [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) when it more "droid-related" project. I hope that ideas give and ease to your next classes, Mr. Moore. I don't mind assisting you in related those ideas.

  May peace reside around you Mr. Moore
